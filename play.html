        <h2>Tartuffe</h2>
        <h6>Mme. Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.
            Elmire.  I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.
            Mme. Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
                    I don't wish to cause you any bother.
            Elmire.  What duty demands, I insist on giving.
                    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?
            Mme. Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
                    And no one cares what I wish to have done.
                    Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
                    For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
                    And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
                    And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
            Dorine.  If . . .
            Mme. Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
                    A little brazen and very sassy,
                    You butt into everything to speak your mind.
